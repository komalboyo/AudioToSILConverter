Description	
Background: Indian Sign Language (ISL) is a visual-gestural language used by deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals across India. It encompasses a rich vocabulary of hand movements, facial expressions and body postures to convey messaging. ISL facilitates communication and fosters community among deaf individuals, enabling them to express emotions, share ideas and engage in every day interactions. Description: The need for audio to Indian Sign Language (ISL) conversion arrises from the communication barrier between the deaf community, which primarily uses ISL, and individuals who do not know sign language but communicate through spoken language. This barrier hinder effective communication in various settings, including education, healthcare and various interactions. Without a mean to convert audio into ISL, deaf individual faces challenging in accessing information and participating fully in society. Expected Solution: The expected solution entails developing technology-such as software or devices-capable of accurately converting spoken language to Indian Sign Language (ISL). This technology should use speech recognition, natural level processing, and computer vision to transcribe and interpret audio input, generating corresponding ISL gestures in real-time. It should prioritize accuracy, user-friendliness, and adaptibility to regional variation of ISL, thereby facilitating seamless communication between deaf individual and those who do not know sign language.

Development of application by which announcement/ text display in railway platform Display Unit Converted to Indian Sign Language, so that deaf people can see it and understand the announcement. 2. Development of Mobile app through by which using Mobile Camera, normal person can understand sign language used by dead individuals.
